Lets follow any one algorithm for our game to get minimum spanning tree.
- As we had discussion on kruskal's algorithm and found it to be good. We can use Kruskal's algorithm for our game.

- Discription on how we can built the game:-
  At the begining of the game we will give number of moves to the user which will be equivalent to minimum moves required to connect all 
  nodes. Hence In-order to connect all the nodes user has to follow minimum path else he/she will be out of move and the game would be over.
