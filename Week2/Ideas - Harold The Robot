This activity is intended to expose students to the idea that computers follow instructions very precisely, which can be frustrating at times. 

In this game, the user types in commands into a textbox to make the robot perform some actions such as move, walk, lift or jump.
The objective is the make the robot perform some task such as going from A to B and B to C, or going over an obstacle path.
The trick here is, the user does not know which commands will work and which wont.
The robot understands a limited vocabulary of words that are very specifiy.
This in a way, simmulates how programming works.


We could provide some sample commands to get the users started out on.

This can also be extended into a multiplayer game, where multiple players compete to reach a destination or goal with the robots.

//on hold as users may not like the experience of typing commands
