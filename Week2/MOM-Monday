We have decided Greenfoot as the tool we'll use to build our game on.

Discussed about the various activities from CSUnplugged and shortlisted on the following:
1.Finite State Automata- Treasure Island
2.Minimal Spanning Tree- Muddy Road and
3.Programming Language - Harold the Robot

Decided to write to the professor for further input on the activities and the feasibility of our ideas.
