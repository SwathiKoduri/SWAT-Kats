between the islands in this part of the world, offering rides to travellers. Each island has
two departing ships, A and B, which you can choose to travel on. You need to find the
best route to Treasure Island. At each island you arrive at you may ask for either ship A
or B (not both). The person at the island will tell you where your ship will take you to
next, but the pirates donâ€™t have a map of all the islands available. Use your map to keep
track of where you are going and which ship you have travelled on.
