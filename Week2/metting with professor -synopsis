After having a depth discussion with the professor about the three ideas we had for the project,
we are now moving wtih minimal spanning tree as our porject game.

Professor had suggested us to visit to our users and present them some games in minimal spanning tree, so that we 
understand the requirement of our client.

Professor want us to make a game , which is interesting so that we like developing it, rather than just coding anything.
